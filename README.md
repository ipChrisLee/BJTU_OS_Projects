This is public repo for OS course projects on BJTU, written by ipLee.

I decide to public it and am not afraid of been copied is just because it is written in Rust, and I believe if you can learn Rust well, there is no need for you to steal my code.

This "README.md" is located on root of folder, and every sub folder of this root is a root of a subproject. Feel free to read!

NOTICE: This is OS projects of HuangHua class, which may not be same as yours!

> I found that Huanghua OS projects are from *OS Concepts*. Correspondence is listed here.

> * lee_shell: Chap03 Project01
